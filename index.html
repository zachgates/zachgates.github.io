					<p>Python Developer</p>
					<p>I started programming with Python in early 2011. Now, over 5 years later, I'm creating multipurpose applications; turning concepts into reality.</p>
					<p>Python is my favorite language to program in because of it's speed, flexibility, and power to quickly solve complex problems. If you're reading this as a developer, I strongly recommend learning Python.</p>

					<p>I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of tools; namely jQuery, PHP, and Django. Currently, I utilize these tools on a daily basis in my work as a freelancer.</p>
